                    The world has a wealth of diversity and its cuisines are no exception. There are so many 
                    interesting places to visit but a few destinations top the list for me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Japan is definitely at the top of the list for me.  I enjoy many kinds of Japanese food, from sushi
                    to ramen, from tonkatsu to teppanyaki.  I have enjoyed following YouTubers who showcase the different
                    foods of Japan.  This includes the bounty of amazing foods you can enjoy at Japanese convenience stores.
                    I wouldn't know how much time to spend in Japan because there are so many foods to try and so many 
                    interesting places to discover.

                    Another top destination is South Korea.  Thankfully both it and Japan could be visited within the same
                    trip due to their proximity.  I do not know a lot about South Korea and where to visit but my wife and I 
                    know many International Students who have moved back to South Korea after studying in Canada.  On top
                    of visiting old friends, there's also the food.  While I have not been exposed to all of the wonderful
                    cuisine of Korea, I have very much so enjoyed Korean BBQ, bibimbap, and LA galbi.  I also love the small 
                    side dishes called banchan, that are served with your meal.  My favourite is the sweet fried potatoes.
