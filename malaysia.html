                <h2>Malaysia</h2>
                <p>
                    My mom's family is from the island of Penang in Malaysia. I have been blessed to
                    be welcomed into their homes and shown around to the local eating places whenever
                    I have visited.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There is a night and day difference when you have local people who can show you whenever
                    the locals would actually eat.  The food in Penang, especially its street food is some
                    of the best food I have eaten and costs about $2.50 CDN per meal!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are so many good dishes to try and so little time, so I will focus on three standout
                    dishes that you should try if you ever have the pleasure of visiting Penang.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My favourite dish that is widely available is Hokkien Mee (noodle soup).  Hokkien is the
                    Chinese sub-culture that is most prevalent in Malaysia.  Mee means noodle.  There is a
                    dry, fried noodle dish called Hokkien Mee, but you will want to try the noodle soup version.
                    It is a soup broth that is rich with shrimp flavour, coconut milk, and the right amount of
                    chili.  It is often served with both thin vermicelli rice noodles and thicker yellow egg
                    noodles; the combination creating textural variety.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The next dish, is the national dish of Malaysia: Nasi Lemak.  Nasi means rice, and Lemak means
                    creamy or rich.  It's history was as the original fast food of Malaysia, as the entire dish is 
                    wrapped in a banana leaf; providing portability and old-world charm.  The dish is rice cooked in
                    coconut milk, served with fried chicken, tiny fried fish and peanuts, and a paste made of ground
                    chilies and shrimp called sambal.                     
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The final dish is not widely available, and it was from a tiny food stall in Butterworth: the
                    mainland section of Penang.  It was a fish head curry that is served with a combination of rice
                    and kasava.  I have had curries from many different cultures and have not found one that compares
                    to this fish head curry.  The taste in unmistakeable and you will order bowl after bowl of rice
                    and kasava to bathe in the wonderful curry gravy.
                </p>
