                <h2>Italy</h2>
                <p>I had the privelage of visiting both Rome and Florence in Italy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I must say one of my regrets was not properly researching Italy before visiting it.
                    As a result, I felt I didn't get the most I could have gotten out of my trip. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The standout dish for me was a close tie.  The first dish was a steak in Florence that
                    was served with a balsamic vinegar reduction.  A combination I would have never thought
                    of.  The tantilizing flavour of vinegar made the steak taste even better. I would describe
                    it as a cross between eating steak and salt & vinegar chips.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    That delicious steak was in a tie with a tripe dish also from Florence.  I know what many
                    of you are thinking: tripe? what is tripe?.  And the rest of you are thinking: ugh no!
                    Not tripe!  Yes tripe comes from the stomach of either a pig or cow, but with most 
                    unconventional dishes: keep an open mind and it matters how its prepared.  This tripe
                    was deep fried, like calamari, then baked with a thick tomato sauce and topped with 
                    parmaesan cheese. Yum!
                </p>
